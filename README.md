# gvisGauge
Demonstration of the gvisGauge function from the googleVis package. Includes display within a shiny wrapper.

Note: This has been built to demonstrate gauges - I haven't done any data cleaning, filtering, or other due diligence with the data! Feel free to add such functions if you'd like to use the tool to build models rather than demo gauges.
